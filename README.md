# British-Airways-Project
# Task 1
**Project Description:**

In this project, I scraped and analyzed customer reviews from Skytrax to gain insights into British Airways' performance. Using Python, I cleaned the data and employed sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques. The findings were summarized in a PowerPoint slide for actionable business insights.
This task involved scraping customer review data from the Skytrax website, analyzing the collected data to uncover insights, and presenting these findings on a single PowerPoint slide. The goal was to understand customer sentiment and feedback about British Airways (BA) by analyzing reviews specifically about the airline.

To accomplish this task, I utilized Python for data scraping, cleaning, and analysis. The initial step involved scraping review data from the Skytrax website, focusing on reviews related to BA. Once the data was collected, I performed data cleaning to prepare it for analysis. This included removing noise, handling missing values, and standardizing the format of the text data.

After cleaning the data, I conducted various analyses such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and word cloud generation to gain insights into the content of the reviews. These analyses helped to understand the overall sentiment of customers towards BA, identify common themes or topics mentioned in the reviews, and visualize frequently occurring words.

Finally, I summarized the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis into a single PowerPoint slide. This included visualizations such as sentiment distribution charts, word clouds, and metrics related to customer feedback. Clear and concise explanations were provided to quickly convey the main points from the analysis.

By completing this task, I was able to provide valuable insights into customer sentiment and feedback about BA, which can be used by stakeholders to make informed decisions and improve the overall customer experience. The use of Python for data analysis allowed for efficient processing of the collected data and generation of insightful visualizations.

# Task 2
**Project Description:**

In this project, we aim to leverage data and predictive modeling to enhance customer acquisition for airlines, focusing on British Airways. By analyzing customer booking data, we seek to build predictive models using Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers. We explore two scenarios: one with only the top six features identified through feature selection, and another utilizing all available features. Through data exploration, feature engineering, and model training using the scikit-learn library in Python, we aim to predict booking outcomes and identify key factors influencing customer behavior. Our analysis includes evaluation of model performance, interpretation of variable contributions, and presentation of findings in a concise PowerPoint summary.
