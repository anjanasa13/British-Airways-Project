# British-Airways-Project
In this project, I scraped and analyzed customer reviews from Skytrax to gain insights into British Airways' performance. Using Python, I cleaned the data and employed sentiment analysis and topic modeling techniques. The findings were summarized in a PowerPoint slide for actionable business insights.
